# Rapid_Systems_Prototyping

This repository contains all related material I created for my presentations on "Rapid Prototyping of Digital Systems" for the University of Patras' ACM Student branch.
It contains:
- Presentation material
- Lab Handouts with the rubrics of the problems we'd tackle within the lab
- Verilog code of both the presentation circuits as well as the solutions to the problems

Testbenches may be added in the future, but currently they are not of high priority
Language: Greek (presentations, lab problems) & English (code comments, signal declarations)
